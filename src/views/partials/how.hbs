          <p class="text-left"> Deep Based Physics Rendering uses AI to remove shadows and generate your image maps through deep learning. The Deep Physics Engine has learnt from other images and other textures, so that it can create normal maps, roughness maps and diffuse (delit) images from a simple photo, taken in normal light.
            <br> </p>
          <p class="text-left">Once it has generated normals, roughness and diffuse images from the source image, it's a simple matter of rendering this in your favorite rendering pipeline. We demonstrate here with WebGL in your browser.&nbsp;</p>
